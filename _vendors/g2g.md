True Take Media helps grocery stores and their vendors produce and manage online video advertising campaigns that increase brand awareness and help move products faster.
 
We’re working with {{ page.name }} to produce a campaign for your store and we need your help.
 
This campaign will:
Cost you nothing to produce.
Comes with a $250 ad credit (enough to reach about 5,000 customers)
And is fully managed… which means it’ll take almost none of your time.
 
Here’s how it works:
We work closely with your vendor to produce a high quality video ad that will capture your customers attention, educate them about the product and draw them into your store. 
Next we’ll customize the ad by putting your stores logo at the beginning and end of the video so there will be no confusion about where to find the product.
And finally… we launch a paid advertising campaign targeting customers within a 1-10 mile radius of your store.
 
Here are the results you can expect.
During the campaign you’ll see a huge spike in movement rates for the product we’re promoting as well as a good bump in sales across the department or category and typically you’ll continue to see higher than average movement for months or years after the campaign ends.
 
So, if you want a simple way to move a lot of product...
All you need to do is schedule a Campaign Planning Meeting and we’ll work out the details like getting your logo and how many customers you want to reach.
 
It only takes a few minutes on the phone and we’ll have your campaign up and running in no time.
 
Just text, call, email or go to our website to schedule your campaign planning meeting.
