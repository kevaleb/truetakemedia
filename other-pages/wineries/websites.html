      These days most of your customers will be looking you up on their phones
      which means you need a site that loads instantly. If your customers have
      to wait around… they’ll leave and never come back.

      Once the page actually loads you need to wow them immediately by how
      amazing your winery is. You can’t expect them to dig through your site
      looking for photos and stuff to read. If they aren't amazed within 3
      seconds most people will leave and never come back.

    feature_description_markdown: >-
      Once your site visitor decides to stick around a bit, it needs to be easy
      for them to find the information they’re looking for. Don’t make them work
      their way through multiple layers of navigation to get directions to your
      tasting room. They should be able to find it intuitively, without even
      thinking. The goal is for them to physically find their way to your
      tasting room, right?

    feature_description_markdown: >-
      Websites are supposed to make your life easier. You shouldn’t have to put
      a lot of work into up keeping your site. It should sit there quietly
      humming along, doing its job without any help from you and when you do
      need to make changes like updating your holiday hours or posting an
      upcoming event it should be so simple… a baby could do it.
