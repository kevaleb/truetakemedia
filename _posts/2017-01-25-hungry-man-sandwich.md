When we first started working with Bee’s Marketplace we decided to promote a product from their deli... we settled on the 

## “Hungry Man Sandwich”

We produced a simple ad comparing the size of a Hungry Man to that of a Subway Footlong.

We spent $9.57 promoting the video to anyone within 20 miles of the store and reached 844 people an average of 1.87 times each.

### So… what were the results?
