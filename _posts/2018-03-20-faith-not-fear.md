## "Faith Not Fear" is a book about a man's journey to the other side.

We were asked to help promote the book before its launch so we wanted to see which type of promotion got the highest reach.

<!--more-->

#### 1. Text Post
![334 reach](/images/posts/faith-not-fear/fnf-3.jpg "334 reach")
First we posted a snippet from the book as a regular text post to the facebook page with no paid advertising… We reached 334 people.

#### 2. Promoted Text Post
![749 reach](/images/posts/faith-not-fear/fnf-2.jpg "749 reach")
Next we posted another plain text post but this time we “boosted” it with $5 to people who liked the page and friends of people who liked the page… We reached a total of 749 people.

#### 3. Promoted Video Post
![2912 reach](/images/posts/faith-not-fear/fnf-1.jpg "2912 reach")
Then we posted a video of the author describing part of his experience and spent $5 promoting the post to followers and friends of followers... we reached 2,912 people.

> By posting a video instead of just txt and spending $5 on advertising we were able to increase our reach by 871%.

<!--So... why is this happening?

### Facebook is playing favorites.
- **Limited Organic Reach**
	It’s no secret that when you post on your facebook page it will only be seen by a small percentage of your followers the only way around that is to pay facebook to reach more people.
- **Interaction Bonus**
	Facebook closely monitors how people interact with you content, if there is a lot of interaction they’ll will show it to more people, but if there is low interaction facebook will stop showing it to anyone else. 
- **Video Posts**
	Facebook is waging a war against Youtube, they need people to spend more time watching video on their platform, so they’re giving an unfair advantage (in the form of increased reach) to video content posted to facebook to entice video creators to their side of the fence. Also… videos just get higher interaction rates which also helps them get higher reach.

#### So if you want to maximize the number of people you reach through facebook, there is no better way than paid facebook video ads.-->
