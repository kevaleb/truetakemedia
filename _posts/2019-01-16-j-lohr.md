<h2>1. Increased Product Sales</h2>
<img src="/images/posts/j-lohr/wine-sales.jpg" alt="" />
<p>With this ad we were promoting J. Lohr wine at Bee's Marketplace. The campaign lasted 25 days. During that time we increased the sales of J.Lohr wine by 348%.
<br /><br />
After the campaign ended sales never fell back to their pre-campaign levels. Instead we maintained a 90% increase in sales of J. Lohr wines over the following year.</p>

<p>Seeing this kind of long term increase in sales for a product we promote is not unusual.</p>

<h2>Increased Department Sales</h2>
<img src="/images/posts/j-lohr/wine-department-sales.jpg" alt="" />
<p>More impressive than the increase in J. Lohr sales was the overall sales increase for the wine department.</p>
<p>During the campaign we saw an 80% growth in daily movement rates across the entire department. </p>
<p>A full year after the campaign ended we've maintained a 52% increase in wine sales.</p>

<h2>Great Return on Ad Spend</h2>
<img src="/images/posts/j-lohr/return-on-ad-spend.jpg" alt="" />
<p>We estimate this campaign increase wine sales by $12,107 dollars within 1 year of the campaign.</p>
<p>If the campaign cost $500 that would be a 2,422% Return On Ad Spend.</p>
<p><i>To calculate return on ad spend we counted the total increase in J. Lohr sales during & after the campaign plus the increased sales for other wine brands during the campaign (but not after).</i></p>
